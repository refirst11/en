I recently migrated my personal blog to Markdown, and found that managing content using a CMS was easy and convenient. However, I soon realized that deleting content was also easy and irreversible. Markdown, on the other hand, is managed using Git, which is a big advantage.

In this post, I'll share my experience with using Next.js 13's appDirectory, and discuss some of the issues I encountered.

### Framer Motion

I found that the exit feature did not work well, but with some effort, it was possible to wrap everything in a single animation using RootLayout.

### Dev Mode

The UI layout was often broken, and the skeleton would be displayed during the loading stage, with styles being applied later. Moreover, the startup time was significantly slower compared to Next.js 13 (stable), which was a major issue for me.

However, API handlers and metadata worked well.

I'll continue to use appDirectory, and hope that the issues I encountered will be resolved in future updates.
