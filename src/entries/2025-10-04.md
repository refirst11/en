In today's development, it's common to use AI throughout, from deciding what you want to create to the final testing.

However, you should never say that you created it with AI.
This is the best way to maintain your identity and credibility.

I currently use Gemini CLI throughout my development.

Using the AI ​​agent allows me to see things from a different perspective, even when developing alone.

I believe this will be a great collaborator that will significantly reduce the amount of work developers have to do and dramatically shorten the release cycle.

There's no need to be humble about AI; just say that you created it using AI.
If you say that AI created it, you're handing all the responsibility to AI and it will undermine the credibility of the person who created it.

That's all for today.
