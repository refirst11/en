Until 2014-06-05.
When I age is 19, I had a connection with someone from the christ society, and they to drive me from the United States to Canada.  
It's may to say, the taste of hamburger was I hate to me.
and for the first three days, I couldn't eat anything.
I really feeling like the not match the eat tasting.

The world of Vancouver was so amazing., and I experienced of nature firsthand.

Afterward, I stayed at the room of an in Seattle, and I thought that religious and the habit of going to church were a good thing.

I had an experience that left a lasting impression on me and made me feel the atmosphere and time.
