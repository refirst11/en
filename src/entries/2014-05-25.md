This is a recent article about an experience that occurred on May 25th, 2014.

When I was 19 years old, I had a connection with someone from the Christ Society, and they offered to drive me from the United States to Canada. Although it may sound controversial to say, the taste of hamburgers was like radiation to me, and for the first three days, I couldn't eat anything.

I really felt the meaning of "not suiting one's taste" during that time. Vancouver and the frozen world felt like a world brought to life from within a video game, and I experienced the awe of nature firsthand.

Afterward, I stayed at the room of an important person in Seattle, and I thought that religious practices were a good thing. It's different from people who watch TV while eating their meals.

I really want to go back there again.
