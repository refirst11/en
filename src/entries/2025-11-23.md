### Problem

Runtime should not exist in styling.
Complexity should not leak.
Tools should disappear.

### Intent

Plumeria embraces an optimistic syntax.
No constraints.
Just TypeScript, and the shapes you write.

### Execution

A fully–static compiler.
Deterministic.
It reads your code, resolves, expands, reduces—
and leaves nothing at runtime.

### Design

StyleX optimizes for scale.
Plumeria optimizes for authorship.
Both speak of “authoring”,
but walk different road.

### Essence

Let code stay simple.
Let the compiler handle the weight.
Let authors create. Not configure.
