### problem

Runtime should not exist in styling.
Complexity should not leak.
Tools should disappear.

### ways

Plumeria embraces an optimistic syntax.
No constraints.
Just TypeScript, and the shapes you write.

### execution

A fully–static compiler.
Deterministic.
It reads your code, resolves, expands, reduces—
leaving nothing at runtime.

### designing

Both StyleX and Plumeria.
Both speak of authoring.
but walk different paths.

### enlightenment

Let code stay simple.
Let the compiler handle the weight.
Let authors create-and not configure.
