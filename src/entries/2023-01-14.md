With this script, Windows users can experience the convenience of Mac keybindings without having to purchase a Mac computer. The script is designed for those who primarily use Windows but want to try out the Mac user interface.

Usage to use the script, download the zip file from the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/su-pull/macintosh-ahk) and launch it on a Windows machine with AutoHotkey installed. Once launched, the script will run in the task tray, and you can exit by right-clicking and selecting "Exit". If you're using an application that requires administrator privileges, be sure to launch this ahk script with administrator privileges.

This script allows you to customize your keyboard shortcuts to your preference, including swapping the Capslock key with the Control key. Recommended tools to enhance your experience include HHKB or Realforce, ChangeKey, and PowerToys. However, it's not recommended to use Ctrl2Cap because it can't swap keys effectively, and registry binary rewriting is also not recommended.

I personally put this script in my startup application folder so that I can use it seamlessly on my Windows machine.
