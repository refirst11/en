Hi! I recently rewrote Juster with AHK Version2, just released it published as Juster v.2.0.0.
As a newly added function, IME switching using the English layout of Alt, and The CapsLock and LeftControl keys have been swapped without modifying the registry.

It does a lot of stable work, instead of the unstable Script that it used to have.
The package contains the following \_JIS in addition Default and Swapped Version
Will not your computer is restarting.

With this application is Windows users can experience the convenience of Mac keybindings without having to purchase a Mac computer. This is designed for those who primarily gift from me, use Windows but want to try out the Mac key bindings.

Let's clone or fork the [Juster](https://github.com/su-pull/Juster) and installing [AutoHotkeyV2](https://www.autohotkey.com/), right click and select Programs, after let's running with , launching in the task tray.
If you're running an application that requires administrator,launch Juster with admin rights.

I'm a Juster_Swapped.ahk in my startup application folder so that I can use it seamlessly on my starts with Windows.

"I will continue development if you give me a star."
