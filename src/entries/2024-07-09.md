Hello, on this page I would like to explain what can be done by looking at the code that combines the two libraries.

In this way, you can use it as a single component, with the scope closed as a single page file.

## Creation of Animation.css.tsx

```tsx title="Animation.css.tsx"
'use client';

import { ReactNode } from 'react';
import { useAnimation } from 'firemotion';
import { Style } from 'typedcssx';

type AnimationProps = {
  children: ReactNode;
};

const Animation = ({ children }: AnimationProps): JSX.Element => {
  const animate = useAnimation(styles.base, [styles.init, styles.exit], 0.2);

  return <main className={animate}>{children}</main>;
};

const styles = Style.create({
  base: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: 'all 0.6877777s',
    scale: 1,
  },

  init: {
    opacity: 0,
    scale: 1.1,
  },

  exit: {
    opacity: 0,
    transition: 'all 0.17s',
    scale: 1.1,
  },
});

export default Animation;
```

Each function made up of Style is defined in function, and function hoisting occurs, making it possible to write it later.
In this way, using typedcssx you can write Next.js components in a React Native like way.

## how to use Animation

```tsx
const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Animation>
      <h1>hello world</h1>
      <p>welcome my website!<p>
    </Animation>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## summary

Using typedcssx makes it easy to write pseudo elements and keyframes, and auto-complete is available, so you can get a development experience with TypeScript that is no different from writing CSS.

Also, by passing the typedcssx value as an argument, you can easily create components whose size, etc. can be changed by changing the value.

So, have fun building your advanced UI libraries!
