Using tools like EsLint and Stylelint can actually decrease development efficiency.

Explanation:
EsLint and Stylelint are commonly used tools in the development process to help ensure code quality and consistency. However, if not properly configured or integrated into the development workflow, these tools can actually hinder productivity.

For example, if the rule set for EsLint or Stylelint is too strict or not properly customized for the project, developers may spend more time fixing minor issues flagged by the tools rather than focusing on more important aspects of the codebase. Additionally, if these tools are not integrated into the development workflow properly, they may slow down the feedback loop and make it harder for developers to iterate quickly.

When using Husky and lint-staged, the pre-commit hooks are executed before the commit is finalized. This means that the EsLint and Stylelint checks are performed every time a developer tries to commit code, which can add up to three seconds of additional time to the commit process. While this may not seem like a lot of time, it can add up over the course of a day or a week of development.
